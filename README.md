# VisionCraft

**VisionCraft** VisionCraft is a personal project I created to streamline the process of gathering detailed website requirements from clients. As a freelance full-stack developer, I wanted a tool that would help me understand my clients' needs, preferences, and expectations more clearly. This tool is designed to gather crucial information, avoid scope creep, and ensure that I deliver a website that aligns with my client’s vision.

By using VisionCraft, I can more accurately define the scope of a project, create realistic timelines, and provide tailored estimates, making the entire development process smoother and more efficient.

## Features

- **Client-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use questionnaire interface for clients to fill out with their website requirements.
- **Customizable Questions**: Ability to customize and add specific questions based on your client's needs.
- **Detailed Insights**: Gather detailed insights on design, functionality, and features required for the website.
- **Prevent Scope Creep**: Establish clear and specific requirements from the start to avoid future changes and delays.
- **Flat Fee Estimation**: Use the gathered information to provide a more accurate and tailored flat fee for your services.

## Why VisionCraft?

As a developer, understanding the client’s vision is essential for delivering the right product. However, many times, clients are unsure about what they want or struggle to communicate their ideas effectively. VisionCraft helps eliminate that confusion by guiding clients through the essential questions needed to define the scope and expectations of their website project.

By creating this tool for myself, I’ve been able to ensure that my client relationships are more transparent, and that I can deliver projects on time and within budget.
